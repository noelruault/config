# TODO checklist

- [ ] `zmodload zsh/zprof` # This will enable the built in profiling. Can be used to analyse loading times
- [ ] Make new iTerm tabs run without plugins by default with some sort of flag. (`if [[ "$1" == "bash:request" ]]; then ...`)
- [ ] Make a log file to record messages like commands or tools not found while loading the scripts etc.
